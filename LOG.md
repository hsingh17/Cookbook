21. Add spinner if MealThumbnail clicked in Search (possibly just move spinner to MealThumbnail)
22. Figure out if it is possible to handle Network Error when navigating to another page while fetch happening
23. Figure out if it possible to delete session when user closes tab instead of logging out
24. Make everything look nice
